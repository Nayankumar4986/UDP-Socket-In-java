Here's a sample `README.md` file for your GitHub repository that includes instructions and explanations for both the UDP client and server code in Java. This will help others understand how to compile, run, and test your UDP client-server application.

# UDP Client-Server Application in Java

This repository contains a simple UDP client-server application in Java. The client sends a message to the server, and the server responds with a greeting message.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Java programming and networking concepts.

### Files

- `UDPClient.java`: The client program that sends a message to the server.
- `UDPServer.java`: The server program that receives a message from the client and responds back.

### Running the Application

#### 1. Compile the Java Code

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Java files are located. Compile both the client and server programs using the following commands:

```sh
javac UDPClient.java
javac UDPServer.java
```

#### 2. Run the Server

Start the server by running the following command:

```sh
java UDPServer
```

You should see the following output indicating that the server is listening on port 8080:

```
Server listening on port 8080
```

#### 3. Run the Client

Open another terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the same directory. Run the client program using the following command:

```sh
java UDPClient
```

You will be prompted to enter a message. Type your message and press Enter. For example:

```
Enter a message:
Hello, server!
```

The client will send the message to the server, and you should see the following output:

```
Sent 14 bytes to 127.0.0.1
```

On the server side, you will see the received message and the response sent to the client:

```
Client: Hello, server!
The client port is 12345
Message sent to client.
```

### Code Explanation

#### Client Side

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class UDPClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DatagramSocket socket = null;
        try {
            socket = new DatagramSocket();
            InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1");
            int port = 8080;

            // Read input from the user
            BufferedReader userInput = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
            System.out.println("Enter a message:");
            String message = userInput.readLine();

            // Convert the message to bytes
            byte[] buffer = message.getBytes();

            // Create a datagram packet and send it
            DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer, buffer.length, address, port);
            socket.send(packet);

            System.out.println("Sent " + buffer.length + " bytes to " + address.getHostAddress());

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            if (socket != null && !socket.isClosed()) {
                socket.close();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Server Side

```java
import java.net.*;

public class UDPServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DatagramSocket socket = null;
        try {
            socket = new DatagramSocket(8080);
            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];

            System.out.println("Server listening on port 8080");

            while (true) {
                // Receive packet from client
                DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer, buffer.length);
                socket.receive(packet);
                String received = new String(packet.getData(), 0, packet.getLength());
                System.out.println("Client: " + received);

                // Get client address and port
                InetAddress clientAddress = packet.getAddress();
                int clientPort = packet.getPort();
                System.out.println("The client port is " + clientPort);

                // Send response to client
                String response = "Hello from server";
                byte[] responseBytes = response.getBytes();
                DatagramPacket responsePacket = new DatagramPacket(responseBytes, responseBytes.length, clientAddress, clientPort);
                socket.send(responsePacket);

                System.out.println("Message sent to client.");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            if (socket != null && !socket.isClosed()) {
                socket.close();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
